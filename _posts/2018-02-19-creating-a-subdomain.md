Subdomains are great for separating

1. Visit reclaimhosting.com
2. Click **Client Area Login**
3. From the menu, choose **cPanel** and the name of your domain
4. Click **Subdomains**
5. Under _Create a Subdomain_, in the _Subdomain_ field, write what you would like to call your subdomain. In my case I want to create [demo.jadin.me](https://demo.jadin.me) so I will write **demo**

Thats it!
