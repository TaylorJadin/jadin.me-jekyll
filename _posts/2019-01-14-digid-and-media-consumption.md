Typically when we talk about digital identity we focus on our digital footprint or what we leave behind on the web. Lately though I have been thinking about how what I consume on the web affects me, or how my online self affects my offline self.

I have always enjoy reading news articles and blog posts on the internet. I've made a habit of frequently reading blogs and news sites on various topics that interest me (mostly tech, education and music) since high school. For me this behavior has not changed, I STILL read a lot of articles and blog posts, but the methods I consume the majority of my written content on the web has changed.

## Good 'ol bookmarks

I used to simply have a folder of bookmarks that I would visit (one at a time) when I was looking for something to read. Eventually I was able to use browser tabs to make it easy to open multiple sites at once!

## Google Reader (and RSS!)

Then I discovered [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader), an RSS reader, which simply put allows you to subscribe to posts from a favorite sites, and have them delivered to you in an inbox. This was great because it allowed me to subscribe to a much wider variety of sources to read and it even worked pretty well on my 1st generation [iPod Touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch).

Google Reader was a cool service at the time, but I had some problems with my own usage of RSS. I began to treat it like work, like I had to at least skim each and every article that came through to zero out my inbox of articles. This type of thinking caused me to abandon the idea of using Google Reader or other RSS readers and instead transitioned my reading back to just visiting sites by typing them into the address bar of my browser.

## Social Media

Soon, as platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit became more and more popular I began to find myself spending more time there and transitioning more of my reading time away from individual sites. Jumping forward to about 6 months ago I realized that I was seeking out way less individual news sources than I ever had and instead spend most of my reading time on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit. I noticed that the news sites I did visit (that weren't served up by the aforementioned social media platforms) were whittled down to only a few because it was easier to just visit Twitter, Reddit and Facebook. 

This all makes sense. Social media platforms live and die on their ability to keep people engaged. The business models of these sites are based around getting you to spend more time on them, so that you view and engage with advertisements they get paid to display. Therefore, these websites are engineered to make you want to visit them as often as possible and for you to feel like there is always more to discover on them.

The media I consume online is certainly one of the ingredients that make up my persona. At the risk of sounding dramatic, why wouldn't I want to have control over that part of what makes me, me? That being said, I know that I don't want to just stop reading articles and blog posts, so I needed something else to shift those habits over to. It is also worth noting that I don't personally feel the need to completely cut these platforms out of my life, but that I just want to spend less time visiting them.

## Tiny Tiny RSS

This is where RSS readers (remember Google Reader?) come back in to importance for me. Unfortunately Google Reader has been [discontinued since 2013](https://www.google.com/reader/about/) so I started my search for something to replace it. I tried several platforms like [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome), [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/?lang=en_US), and [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/). While those platforms were mostly what I wanted[^1] I felt as long as I was going to take ownership over what I read, I should take ownership of the tool I would use to do my reading as well, so I decided to go with something that I could host on my own domain. 

After some more research I decided on Tiny Tiny RSS, which I have setup with my favorite blogs and news sources at [reader.jadin.me](reader.jadin.me). After some tinkering I got everyting working the way I like AND I solved my problem with feeling stressed out by the number of unread items using this thought technology[^2]:

#### I don't need to read everything in my RSS reader. It is both OK and totally healthy to hit "Mark as Read" on occasion.

Its stupid that I couldn't come to terms with this earlier, but welcome to my brain, I get to live with it. One other tactic I do to balance out the large number of articles that come through from some more mainstream news sources versus the smaller blogs I follow is that I have categories for each. This makes it easier to simply skim the headlines of news websites, yet still read every post from news sources I really care about.

[^1]: I recommend Inoreader if you are not looking to host something yourself.
