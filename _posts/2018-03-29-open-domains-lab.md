We have a budding [Domain of One's Own](https://knight.domains/about/) project at St. Norbert College, and it has been exciting to see our pilot groups and [Tech Bar](https://www.snc.edu/its/services/techbar.html) students jump head-first into building their own slices of the web and taking control of their digital identities! Despite all of this excitement, a sentiment we here again and again from our students, staff, and faculty is that they often have a hard time setting aside time to work on their domains, and they feel like they need a little extra push or encouragement to get to work.

Our idea to solve this was to create a "space" that encourages those of us with domains to work alongside each other physically or virtually. We are calling this **Open Domains Lab**.

## Open Domains Lab has three components:

#### 1. A dedicated time to work on your domain/website:
The first Thursday of the month, every month, from 4 pm to 8 pm CST.

#### 2. A physical space to work alongside others:
We will reserve the lower level of the [Cassandra Voss Center](https://www.snc.edu/cvc/) as a space for people who want to work near others that are also working on their domains and websites. Community members from De Pere and the Greater Green Bay area, as well as SNC students, staff, and faculty are invited to participate.

The Cassandra Voss Center also has a kitchen and has easy to access visitor parking via [lots P14 and P11](http://www.snc.edu/parking/docs/parkingmap.pdf).

#### 3. A virtual space to work alongside others:
If you can't make it to campus, or if you prefer working alone, that is OK! Tweet using [#DoOO](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23DoOO&src=typd) during Open Domains Lab time and ask questions, get advice, or share your work!

## We'll see you Thursday!
We envision this as a great place for people off their work, ask questions, and get inspired! The first Open Domains Lab will be **April 5th, from 4 pm to 8 pm.**
