Typically when we talk about digital identity we focus on our digital footprint or what we leave behind on the web. Lately though I have been thinking about how what I consume on the web affects me, or how my online self affects my offline self.

I have always enjoy reading news articles and blog posts on the internet. I've made a habit of frequently reading blogs and news sites on various topics that interest me (mostly tech, education and music) since high school.

For me this behavior has not changed, I STILL read a lot of articles and blog posts, but the methods I consume the majority of my written content on the web has changed. I used to simply have a folder of bookmarks that I would visit (one at a time) when I was looking for something to read. Eventually I was able to use browser tabs to make it easy to open multiple sites at once!

## Enter Google Reader (and RSS!)

Then I discovered [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader), an RSS reader, which simply put allows you to subscribe to posts from a favorite sites, and have them delivered to you in an inbox. This was great because it allowed me to subscribe to a much wider variety of sources to read and it even worked pretty well on my 1st generation [iPod Touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch).

Google Reader was a cool service at the time, but I had some problems with my own usage of RSS. I began to treat it like work, like I had to at least skim each and every article that came through to zero out my inbox of articles. This type of thinking caused me to abandon the idea of using Google Reader or other RSS readers and instead transitioned my reading back to just visiting sites by typing them into the address bar of my browser.

Soon, as platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit became more and more popular I began to find myself spending more time there and transitioning more of my reading time away from individual sites. Jumping forward to about 6 months ago I realized that I was seeking out way less individual news sources than I ever had and instead spend most of my reading time on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit. I noticed that the news sites I did visit (that weren't served up by the aforementioned social media platforms) were whittled down to only a few because it was easier to just visit Twitter, Reddit and Facebook.

Over the last year this has changed as I've become interested in in [Domain of One's Own](https://blog.knight.domains/about/), [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), and the things lots of other cool people internet are doing in the field of education technology and instructional design. Many of these people blog about their work, but I found it difficult to remember to check in on a regular basis with what they were writing.
