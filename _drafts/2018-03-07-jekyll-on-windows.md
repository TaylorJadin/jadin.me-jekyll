For various reasons that mostly amount to _I want to know be able to know how all the bits of my site work_ I use Jekyll to make to make this blog. I hope to elaborate more on exactly why I do this in another post written at another time.

The reason I am writing this post is because I've hard a hard time finding a set of fast, easy to use and _accurate_ instructions about using Jekyll on Windows. Even the instructions on [Jekyll's own website](http://jekyllrb.com) aren't entirely accurate as of the writing of this post!

This is as much for others as it is for me, as I need a place to keep instructions for myself on how to set this up. My work machine is a MacBook Pro and I tend to update this site mostly from my that Mac, but occasionally I find myself needing to update my site from my Windows machine at home.
